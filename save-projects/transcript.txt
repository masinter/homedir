
a non-profit or incorporate it all
it would seem like useful for new people
coming in
to have a clear concise
definition of what it is we're trying to
do
and i went through the
things that we had we have this document
of different people writing down what
their goals were
we pull up the agenda today
um
navigate to this by going to the
badly page
here the wiki this is the list of all
documents
eating and ginger is nerds so we have
the medley interlude skulls
chad things i had taken from various
people's emails
about why they were on the project and
what they were doing
and uh
we have
this document ongoing projects
which are kind of my summary of what
i've seen people
talk about in their in the weekly
meeting of what they've been doing
and i thought out of these two sources
and our creative imagination you could
come up with something that
someone could write down in the form
of your your bylaws of what
and what you're doing and why you're
doing it
this is from the nolo press how to start
a non-profit corporation in california
and part of the motivation for
this is giving a little more urgency
is the idea that
there's some things that we we don't
have the manpower to do here
and volunteers are it's not something
that someone would volunteer to do
might want to hire some people to help
out a little bit
and then we have some promise at least
an indication of interest
of a substantial donation
from john city brown who was our
manager who fostered the
project when it started and was part of
the xerox
president's award he became cto of xerox
and otherwise successful that he said he
would be willing to
donate some to the point
where well maybe we should take this
more seriously we've been doing it
for a year and it doesn't seem to be
going away
hey and our to-do list keeps on getting
bigger
so um
so i thought you've been preparing
artists with the corporation
there are two things that you need one
is what is the name
of the company interlist.org
but i figured we could spend a lot of
time on that and
and i i thought we should spend at least
a little time
brainstorming uh what ought to be
the purpose
i
i have to say up here in a minute
anyway um doesn't really matter
something that you would write that the
secretary of state of the
the california or the
[Music]
would be able to read and make sense of
that
you know what is it that we're trying to
do
so there's some uh i did ask if someone
was willing to take notes
because i have trouble typing and
talking at the same time any volunteers
i'll try to take some notes larry okay
so um
i thought we would run this as a kind of
brainstorming session not
spend too much time evaluating the
statements
and trying to consolidate but just list
things that we might do you want you
don't want to have to read
and amend your articles of incorporation
too often so we should be expansive
so on the one hand there's maintaining
the medley sources and bringing it up
today
there's modernizing the user interface
to fit in with modern keyboards and
displays and mice
and be more intuitive for users
who are familiar with running on modern
systems with
mac and windows all sharing common
ideas of uh dragging by the title bar
well can i suggest something larry yes
please
okay so i have belonged to two
organizations
but uh right now i belong to a fraternal
organization
um and typically the things that you
just cited are objectives
that are good but they are
perhaps transient because at some point
you succeed
and then you go on to new objectives
right
and you don't keep doing those same
objectives once you succeeded
right so what i would suggest at least
at a as a top
level statement is the purpose of this
foundation would be to promote
the use and understanding of internalism
as a programming language that's
very generic but on the other hand it's
also specific in the sense that we're
not
out there to promote common lisp even
though common lisp is a
as some of the people in the documents
argued
are uh is already a part of medley right
but common lisp has got all its own
supporters
um and in particular we're concerned
about
interlace itself and the fact that maybe
it's
probably the best of all the possible
lisps out there
to misquote voltaire
yeah i i wouldn't mind i think it ought
to be at least
some people's objectives and listed as a
i don't want to list things we're not
going to do right
right we might be
we're interested there's enough interest
that we should be able to cover
extending the xerox common list
to become the ansi standard and then to
make
medley useful as a modern common list of
development environment
for development and comet and medley and
deployment and commonly
well those are all good ideas but i
i'm with steven i'd like to second
what he said keeping your objective
um as broad yet narrow
as possible that is don't list
possible projects he might work on but
talk about
the mission and what they all might have
in common
and you know that will never
never be completely achieved an ongoing
mission yeah the statement of specific
governance and you're in order as well
as
incorporation is brief but in this
section you can go into
describing specific provide some details
of
you this is your major objectives
describe the activities plan to
engage in we might be preparing
documentation
tutorials demos giving talks
hosting scientific meetings
attending promoting the work
um we might be willing to put together a
little kit of a
raspberry pi that boots up in interlaced
on a machine and
and sell that as a
forehead cross or for a
small profit sure so so that's a good
example of a
hardware project that we could engage in
and if i were putting it in the
bylaws or statement of incorporation i'd
limit it to
possible hardware projects possible
software projects include
and that gives us freedom there'll be a
raspberry
pi five you know whatever we don't need
to box ourselves in
but and for that matter we should talk
about the preservation
aspects of this and right you know
working with the computer history museum
or other
organizations like that
yeah to to preserve and promote
yeah right yeah i was just as a
process matter i thought we ought to
list very specific things
now and then try and consolidate
later sure
that's the leadership through quality
whale yeah exactly
another thing that we should deserve
uh is anybody save their ltq manuals
i i did i i had a uh
pointer to i scanned in one of the
it was the doug adams the office
satirists he was hired by xerox to
promote
ltq and it was completely self-bargained
wow that was scott adams
gilbert fame yeah
well so i just sent out an email to
tracy king
to see what documentation she may still
have for
when we created the lfg non-profit
okay um so
that worked whatever we did was
successful
is that so active or did you did it
dissolve
what the lfc nonprofit selected
or did you dissolve it no no it's still
active
yeah so it's still you know we accept
donations
uh run a conference the donations go to
the students
you know to support students coming to
the conference
and stuff so everybody got the tax
deduction
okay yeah so we might we might do the
same we might support
students come work on a project a lot of
internships
uh yeah yeah
all right
and um
right start students or university
programs
we might you know the question about
other lists i think
ought to be open because i could see
taking on
this symbolic emulator and
bringing it under the wing of this
organization
and our d machines in general
yeah i wouldn't want to rule those out i
wouldn't want the
the
the uh wouldn't necessarily want to rule
those out
um so
[Music]
i don't spend too long on this
my suggestion is uh
is see if you could put this out on the
and the wiki
or send it to me and we'll
ask people to
make sure that nothing that they put in
there
this is that you don't find things in
there that you
would like to don't want to be ruled out
under covered by all of the lit lid
are covered by the list that we've
generated
and if not then add to the list
yeah now are we going to make this a
foundation or corporation larry
it turns out that and at least in this
book
there is foundation is just it isn't
illegal in the thing
what we want is a 501 c 3
yeah which is non-profit and but still
has to
file tax data every year right
right so we might need a lawyer to help
with the articles of incorporation
uh afterwards but the first thing that i
want to know and want to see is what our
list is of what we want to do
so that's why this is the earliest first
step make it give them a big list and
work with the lawyer
to narrow that down to the what the irs
and
the government would would expect
to give the 501c3
and
when at least in california and i think
in the federal
you incorporate as a corporation in the
state
and then you apply to the irs for 501 c
3 status which then gives you tax
deductible deductibility
so that's the the process and
one thing you could put the word
foundation in your name
but probably not a good idea
all right you know something more
generic
but you know if we come back so the
names that i
have thought of as one of things around
interlist
things around lists things around
innovation
um invoice
we can take up the name invokes
as the inheritor of invoice technology
i would suggest that we that we call it
something like the interlaced consortium
or the interlist corporation
even though we are going to
um undertake potentially
the uh preservation
and perhaps uh emulation or
uh modernization of other
uh other lisp systems so the other ones
out there for example are symbolics
the ti explorer um there was an
x x lisp at one point uh that was
written in c
right yeah schema i think is still alive
someplace um yeah
i'm not so interested in skiing yeah i'm
not either but and then there were
variations on interlaced
like um interlift uh
vax and interlift 370 which is the first
one that i used
uh back at cia because i had a tape of
it on a vm system
but i've written down four things so far
listening to what people said
sort of promote the use and
understanding of interlift as a modern
programming language
number one promote the continuing
development of advanced computing
environments for artificial intelligence
and machine learning
using list or using interlist even if we
say
intel has been the uh in the goals
we can still say that we're encompassing
all all other lisps that we're
interested in
right um work with the work with
computer history organizations to
preserve the history and application of
lists
systems and applications uh and then
support students through internships to
work on
uh list projects under the guidance of
the well it's not the foundation it
would be the
corporation or consortium or whatever
organization
yeah and earlier i it may have been
larry
um someone mentioned the name
interlist.org for the organization
and i think that's great it says
everything and nothing
and uh you know it doesn't pin us in
it doesn't have the implications
that corporation might have um
yeah corporations they turn people off
you think exactly
yeah right yeah and and i think we need
to be cautious with the envo's
option because since that wasn't
existing or
entity at one point in time yeah that
will
yeah that will get you into yeah that
will get
you into complications with the
california secretary of state
and it's totally avoidable is that name
still
registered to somebody that is there
there has to is there an ownership
a person or entity that owns the name
infos and has trademarked it
there's a uh
a place to look up at the california
secretary of state
i think it would be a bad idea to try to
i mean there's no history
there's like a good history attached to
that name
okay let me carry it forward and par
ourselves
not registered to anyone so i already
take that
so i just want to mention another aspect
is that
you know inner list medley and so forth
was kind of
the first and maybe still uh
a kind of leading residential
programming environment
yes okay you know to kind of
as an exemplar of that
you know right right so
yeah i i'd like to second that and and i
like what
stephen said before but i'd like to
change
one word in it um he described
inter-list as a programming language
which it certainly is but i think if we
were
to describe it as a programming
environment ah that would
encompass what what ron was
was just bringing up and i think um
that would include the language as well
good i just made that change
for you okay thank you so so then you
know
um it's like this this creates a
laboratory
for other people to explore those kinds
of ideas right
well are they i've been attempting to
make a distinction
um more or less consistently between
medley the programming environment
and interlift the programming language
because we've got two programming
languages
right
yeah i i i understand and sympathize
with that
uh i mean we have a middle east
implementation outside medley
you know and we have a common list
implementation inside medley so
if we can make that distinction i think
it's a good one all right
all right well um
this has been helpful
uh larry i'll i'll noodle it a little
bit more and if i could come up with
another two or three goals i'll put them
down and then email this to you
sure i'll stick them on the wiki
and ask people to comment and review the
main i was thinking we should um
i wanted to be able to host
sponsor an event at the computer history
museum
like they did for the alta but for
interlink
okay so i said work with computer
history museum uh sorry
computer history organizations because i
want to include ieee history in there
and acm to preserve the history and
applications of list
systems and applications and then a
another goal would be to promote
um and organize and promote
uh let's say uh conferences
and exhibitions on
the development and use of interlist
all right your list of ideas and other
sentences
other other contexts
you know if we wanted to port master
scope to work on go programs would that
be within our scope
i hope not i'm sorry
our shell script yes much better
i shall i really virtual machines you
take a virtual machine
and you manage its input and output
ports
and that becomes a kind of master scope
target how about saying
uh organize and promote conferences and
exhibitions
uh on the use of ventureless technology
or how about using the word
events which is general okay so
concepts and technology sure
okay on the use of ventureless concepts
and technology
yeah i've been working on this uh
software preservation network
technical infrastructure group and
uh one of the guys just posted this
description of the small talk as uh
and you know maybe we could sponsor
academic
research in the area yeah
all right so we might give grants to
some foundations one of the things that
you have to do when you
start a non-profit corporation is make
plans
for if you shut the organization what
happened to the assets
the assets need to go to another 501c3
and i thought the computer history
museum would be a logical
place to name as our
successor organization
that sounds good yeah i agree that'd be
good
hoping that california doesn't fall into
the ocean anytime soon
all right well if it does it'll take a
lot with the
secretary of state if we don't actually
nominate an organization
um basically the court will find one for
us
right but i think it's necessary when
you file the papers
um yeah i i thought computer history
museum closed or something
no that was the living computing museum
oh in seattle that was a different that
was paul allen's
oh it did close yeah the living
computing museum
which the guy who brought the dark star
emulator
i would say when we could hire him to
you know set up a better exhibit of
interest running under dark star before
getting old to south to run
with a hardware enemy later so that
ought to be somehow in our scope
written up in a way that was generic but
very specifically
you know could we get josh to help out
with
[Applause]
our
they found another job
uh one thing my understanding is that
non-profits get into trouble when they
do one of two things
when they're either
using funds for stuff that isn't in
their charter
or can be applied to the charter
or not using funds that are in their
charter
what for stuff that is in their charter
and not doing it
so we need to walk that line basically
between right things we are committing
to do
and will do and things we are
not committing to do and
but but but fit within generally enough
that we can say yeah we did that well
that's what we'll hire a lawyer for
that's that's a good point but keep in
mind
the secretary of state and the irs are
really not
policing this and
until something brings a violation of
one or the other of those
rules to their attention and maybe even
then
it's just you know they just let these
things go the one thing that can really
get you into
paperwork trouble is not filing with the
irs
annually um in my experience though
going as far as you can with what's in
the nolo book and keeping things
as general as possible without being
completely nebulous yeah and then using
a lawyer
at the end to sanity check it is
probably the best use of time and money
right yeah that's basically what my son
was saying
is prepare what you would send to the
lawyer
and he said he would review it for
if he can understand it then then we can
hire a lawyer more yeah well
i have i have two examples of bylaws
that i can look at one for my sailing
club and one for
my knights of columbus council so i can
look at those
which have both been approved by lawyers
um
and uh filed in the appropriate fashion
and use them as a model and then we can
have a lawyer
tune it and tweak it for the state of
california
right sure that'd be great
all right and i think we've talked about
the name so
with that
uh let's move on
he didn't do
well as you move on i need to drop off
so i'll catch you
uh i think i'm out next week so it'll be
a couple weeks but
thank you i wanted to talk to you about
um
the docker workflow sure
because i think that we need to get
together
and make sure that it is going to
support
what we currently do i'm not sure about
having it automatically
build on commit
right yeah what i've sort of thought
about is it really being kind of nice to
take a step back and sort of figure out
what all we want generated and where we
want that generating so we can sort of
figure out what the whole pipeline
should be
what is generated as uh object files or
executables what goes into docker and
where all that stuff goes
right you know because basically we
what we need to do is be able to
make an edit and then you want to build
make an edit that might change something
i'm going to build it and test it out
before before you
submit it when you submit it it might
build it
just as a sanity check but
you should have already built it and
made all of the other things
all work and that needs to be manually
need to manually generate building and
then maybe doing a release
after you've tested it do a tentative
release test to release
is and then and then maybe build
the docker container out of after you've
done all that
and so
yeah i'm not i'm just not sure the
continuous integration model
is what we're really aiming for we're
more
it was more i could do a release but i
had to run around
and fire up all these machines to do it
all right and the only thing automated
is
building mico for all the machines and
saving it somewhere
that when you've tested it out you can
release it
right and then with docker the other
question is can we run in the cloud
and fire up fire up an instance from a
website
in order to i i don't know did you see
the small time zoo
yeah i saw that uh
i was thinking about in the cloud i
guess the one thing that we need to
sort of address is how we manage
individual users so
yeah you log in you know you create your
initial instance you've made some
modifications
and you exit so you you've kind of
created an individual system at that
point in time if i understand things
correctly so
you know are we going to try to manage
all of that or is it you log out you
just lose everything
every time you log in it's a fresh
instance yeah
i think what i'd like is for you to be
able to
have your own storage and and
rent rent some
web storage on in the name of the
users is then after they've used up
their first
hour of compute time they have to pay
right
and that's something that the interlist
or dot org could
offer you could offer cloud service
software as a service and charge money
for it
and take a profit and use that to pay
for our
our additional help so i wouldn't want
that to be
a possibility to raise funds
you know or bundle it together with seas
volume two and three as well as
the the either the
raspberry pi implementation or a cloud
implementation
so the ways that we can turn this as
my friends pointed out is this
it isn't that you the nonprofit doesn't
mean you can't make money
right right yes all right
you know get people to pay for more
donations
to the history museum for
and um can pay people
you know what you what you can't do is
you know
is have is pay dividends to stockholders
right right or have shares yeah
all right um i wanted the bibliography
to be
maintain a bibliography of literature
about lisbon general
interactive programming and and that we
that ought to be somewhere as an
activity that we might engage in
so that we are especially anything
that's in the ongoing project
those should all be covered by one
clause or another
all right well i need to get going i'm
late to another meeting so
all right great but if you want to talk
i i'm more than happy to schedule some
time
uh later to talk some more about this
right yeah especially maybe with her we
could get together in
sounds good yeah all right take care
let's get into the meeting great
all right so
um so what else is new
i'm catching up on my old mail i want to
forgive people for
responding about a month and a half
later
the email that you sent and
i got ahead of me
so
a much chatter about um about character
encodings
right how to how not to what to do with
them blah blah blah
right it's all in uh it's in issue 350
so if anybody
wants to know what's going on it's there
plus i've been growing my gist quite a
lot it's no longer a simple list of
hey we should have these scripts
all right you need if you uh
what does it take to get the you're just
into the medley just
that
what sorry is that a problem
i couldn't hear the question get it into
the interview
organization
larry wants to move the gist under the
interlibrary tree
oh oh oh oh sure no problem
people will look for it there yeah
i didn't understand what just was or why
we should use it
yeah just as just a it's just a uh it's
just a
repo with one document in it that github
makes it very easy to make an edit it's
usually used for informal stuff
before it gets moved to an actual repo
github has this thing called projects
and i hadn't understood how that was
useful or whether or not it would be
useful
for us to take some of these ongoing
projects and make them
projects
i went to some effort to take a bunch of
issues and move them to discussion
and i'm not sure how successful that's
been
and it seems more confusing than it is
some things are discussions some of
these are issues at the time i thought
well there were discussions that didn't
seem to be converging
didn't have a didn't have something that
you say okay we fix this and move on
and then so uh that's right
is not to worry about it just simply i
mean projects are full of issues that
that never get resolved or they're
resolved years later
you know it doesn't cost anything to
have an issue
all right well the discussion turns out
when you say take an issue
the way that you make a discussion is
you take an issue and say
turn this into a discussion which is a
one-way
street which seems backwards yeah which
is why i wouldn't do it
okay also then you have to know
whether somebody should look for
something as an issue or as a discussion
okay and so why need to do that why do
you need to search or look
in two places and figure it out
yeah it turns out that well if you do
here you go here just discussions
turns into a query
i mean i think it's a semantic
distinction without much bite
yeah and uh yeah all right well
i thought i won't convert anymore
anymore i won't do that again
and for now let's take discussions until
they
until they have something that actually
seems like you might want to close it
and then turn it into an issue and or
into a set of issues and
