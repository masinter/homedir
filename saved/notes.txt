It would useful for new people coming in to have a clear concise definition of what it is we're trying to do.ñ

We have Issues and Tasks and Discussions and the Individual goals,
but not a clear overall set of goals for the group.

We want to synthesize an overall goals statement that
correlates the projects to the objectives.

This should be in the form that would be suitable for the statement of
purpose when forming a non-profit company in California even if we
don't do that.

Notes from 2 Aug 21 discussion

Name: Interlisp.org
  the domain is registered, it's about Interlisp, it's not-for-profit (no 501c3 status required for .org). Some discussion about "Interlisp Foundation" or "Interlisp Consortium".

Current activities' objectives: 
* maintaining the medley sources
  * bringing it up to date
  * finding and fixing bugs
* modernizing the user interface
  * to fit in with modern keyboards and displays and mice
  * be more intuitive for users familiar with common UI idioms
* Deploy Medley widely
  * Port to windows, mac, ios, browser (WebASM)
* Make medley useful  as a Common Lisp IDE
  * Extend Medley's Common Lisp to conform to ANSI standard

Longer term more generally:

* Promote the use and understanding of Interlisp as a programming language and develpment environment

* Preserve Interlisp and its history so others can experience what it was like, and not just read about it in old papers.

This says "Interlisp", we perhaps should say "Medley Interlisp" and
note that this includes a "common lisp" but common lisp has its own
supporters and in particular we're concerned about interlisp itself
and the fact that maybe it's probably the best of all the possible
lisps. (joke)


Other activities that should be possible (not in Charter or Bylaws
but listed to make sure they aren't excluded):
* Preparing documentation, tutorials, demos
   * Purchase software to accomplish
   * Offer Raspberry Pi kit for maker projects
   * Host a Interlisp get-together of users and implementers
   * Work with Computer History groups to enable access by archivists
   * Develop Interlisp-style "residential" programming for today's "DevOps" settings, currently wired together with scripts.
   
Please review; please add to this list if there are things you
want to make sure aren't ruled out.

I think this will help out in our discussions with potential
partners.

Work with computer history organizations to preserve
the history and application of lisp systems and applications and
then support students through internships to work on lisp projects
under our guidance.

Interlisp was and maybe still a kind of leading residential programming
environment.

* create a laboratory for other people to explore those kinds of
ideas. Distinguish Interlisp the language from Medley as a programming environment.
